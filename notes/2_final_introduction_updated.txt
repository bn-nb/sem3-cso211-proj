INTRODUCTION 

Machine learning and artificial intelligence models are used in nearly all industry sectors today, including those in the automotive, healthcare, financial, and semiconductor industries. Earlier, the core of AI was ML models. But when AI spread across many industries and grew in demand, ML models became nothing more than a commodity and no longer the core of AI. Instead, greater performance in ML models and Systems would be driven by the training data. Data is therefore the new oil. People frequently believe that data is static, which is a major factor in ML models becoming commonplace. The data literally means "that which is supplied," which is true. For the majority of individuals, machine learning entails downloading a pre-made dataset and creating a model. Afterward, work on enhancing the model's performance. What we refer to as data in real-time business is the result of the processes. When compared to actual model construction, maintaining and enhancing the deployed models accounts for a larger share of the cost and efficacy of many real-time ML systems. The main answer for these applications is to improve the quality of the data. 

Everyone who uses machine learning (ML) agrees that actual data cleansing and preparation account for 80% of ML activities. Therefore, a key duty for an ML engineer to take into consideration is assuring the data quality. Data fluctuates significantly for higher stakes ML/AI. This data flow has a longer duration and various unfavorable effects. From data collection through model deployment, data movement can occur anywhere. Conventional methods which are completely dependent on code are overshadowed by modern day ML/AI systems which takes into consideration both code and data. Practitioners strive to work upon the model/code to improve ML/AI system instead of focusing more on data part of the system. However, it is often preferable to improve the input data in actual applications than experimenting with various models. Through case studies in AI, Computer Vision, and other fields, Andrew Ng illustrated this concept and showed how enhancing the data will result in a better model. AI systems that are model-centric focus on how to alter the model (code) to enhance performance. Data Centric AI's prime focus is to amend the input-output labels in a systematic manner so as to achieve a model with better performance. Model centric and data centric methods need to be balanced well in order to provide a strong AI solution. 

This paper brings together pros of both the approaches rather than discarding any of them completely. We contend that, in order to overcome the model-centric AI's shortcoming, additional consideration must be given to the alternative data-centric AI. This shouldn't, however, lead to a decline in interest in the model-centric strategy because it gives us the anchor, we need to evaluate an AI system's performance as the data set is upgraded. The structure of the essay is as follows. We present the idea of data-centric AI and explain why it is becoming more and more popular among ML practitioners in Section II. Section III offers a road map for achieving data-centric AI. We support our position with arguments in Section IV, where we also wrap up the essay.
