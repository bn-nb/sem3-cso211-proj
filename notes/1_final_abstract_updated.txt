Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are primarily algorithms that learn archetypal traits from massive data clouds to solve problems. There are two primary approaches for enhancing the AI systems perfomance: model-centric AI and data-centric AI. Model centric AI entails incrementally enhancing an algorithm or piece of code while maintaining the nature and volume of the data being collected. In data centric AI, the data quality is continually improved, keeping the model constant. Even while model-centric AI has dominated over the previous three decades, it has recently come under fire for being restricted to business and industries where platforms with millions of users may freely rely on generalized solutions. Instead of advocating either approach, this paper supports a 'both and' position. The alternative data-centric approach may well be necessary to overcome the accused limitations of model centric AI. It shouldn't, however, lead to a reduction in interest in model-centric AI. According to us, successful 'problem solving' requires both an analysis of how we act upon things (algorithm) and an understanding of their data/properties and states.
